***************
Using The IBIS Models

The IBIS models come in 3 levels. Each use a different subcircuit
topology, but produce similar results. A schematic and netlist 
describing each of the subcircuit levels (IBIS1, IBIS2, and IBIS3)
are located in the CIRCUITS directory. In general, the IBIS level
2 and level 3 subcircuits are the faster than level 1 (by 30% to 200%) and 
produce more true-to life results. However, they are more difficult
to make because they require SPICE MOSFET and DIODE models, rather than
the "plug-in" table type models. Note: SpiceMod can be a big time-saver
when developing the MOS and Diode models.

I/O VOLTAGE LEVELS
        Input Voltage    Supply Voltage   Enable Voltage  Program Required
IBIS1     Rail-Rail         Rail-Rail       Rail-Rail      IsSpice3
IBIS2     0 - 1V            Rail-Rail       0 - 1V         SPICE 2G.6
IBIS3     Rail-Rail         Rail-Rail       Rail-Rail      IsSpice3

Note: IBIS level 2 REQUIRES 0 - 1V levels for both the input and enable
lines.

To use the IBIS models with SpiceNet
  * Copy the models to your library directory (Normally \SPICE\PR)
  * Add the "IBIS1.LIB" filename to the LIB.@@@ file
  * Add the contents of the DBASE.ADD file to your DBASE.SRC file
  * Update the SpiceNet database by running SINDEX and DBMAKE 
  * Call the part from the SpiceNet Browse menu as normal

IBIS SUBCIRCUIT NAMES
Each Model/Part name begins with an abbreviation of the part number. A
suffix letter (I or O) is then added to indicate whether the buffer is 
an I/O device or only an Input load only. Another letter is then added to 
indicated Best, Worst, or Typical behavior. 

Most of the models use IBIS level 1, so the IBIS1.LIB/IBIS1A.LIB files
are normally called. To use another library level, first check to see
that the model is supported. Intusoft user's can then simply change
the *INCLUDE statement from *INCLUDE IBIS1.LIB to *INCLUDE IBIS2.LIB,
for example.

You can see what models are currently supported by what level by 
viewing the README.DOC file on this disk or the .LIB files themselves.

***********
What The Models Can Do

The IBIS models are not functional. They do not perform the same function 
as the part. The models are only to be used as drivers and circuit loads.
Their main use is in PCB and IC interconnect simulations. Intusoft has 
other "exact transistor" and behavioral models that are both functional 
and I/O capable.

***********
Making Your Own Digital Buffer Models From IBIS Data

First, you must obtain IBIS data sheets from the hardware manufacturer.
At this point you may contact Intusoft Technical Support and request 
that a model be made for you, or, you can do it yourself (See below)
Note: It is a good idea to obtain the IBIS specification from INTEL.
Call 1-800-548-4725, ask for literature # 297 267-001.

For all models and levels....
Best Case uses: IOLMAX, IOHMAX, Min Rise/Fall Ramp Times, Min Packaing Characteristic
Worst Case uses: IOLMIN, IOHMIN, Max Rise/Fall Ramp Times, Max Packaing Characteristic 

Note: When making your own models it is best to start with a copy of 
one of the exisiting models and modify it.


** IBIS Level 1 - INTEL's Basic Subcircuit

Enter the Package parasitic values from the IBIS data sheet into the
elements ROPKG, LOPKG, COPKG, and CCOMP.

Calculate the RTF/RTR resistors. Insert the values into the *DEFINE
statements. RTR = 1e5/(Rise_Ramp_Time), RTF = 1e5/(Fall_Ramp_Time)
For example, with the Rise Ramp Time (min 5.0/1.0 = 5) RTR=20K
(This step not required for Input only loads)

Construct the If-Then-Else expressions for the 
Diode Clamps (VCC_OUT, and GND_OUT) and
Pull-up/Pull-down structures (EPWL_DNX, EPWL_UPX, EPWL_DNN, EPWL_UPN)
(contact intusoft if you are having trouble with this step)

IBIS Level 2 - Intusoft's Enhanced SPICE 2 Compatible Subcircuit

Enter the Package parasitic values from the IBIS data sheet into the
elements ROPKG, LOPKG, COPKG, and CCOMP.

Calculate the SWITCH (RTR) and NSWITCH (RTF) resistors. Insert the 
values into the last position in the G1 polynomials in the SWITCH 
and NSWITCH subcircuits. 
SWITCH G1 value = (Rise_Ramp_Time)/800
NSWITCH G1 value = (Fall_Ramp_Time)/800
For example, with the Rise Ramp Time (min 5.0/1.0 = 5) the
G1 statement in the SWITCH subcircuit would be
G1 1 2 POLY(2) 1 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 6.25M   ;160 Ohms
(This step not required for Input only loads)

Construct SPICE models for the diodes and MOSFETs based on the V-I 
characteristics given.
Diode Clamps (DIODEV, and DIODEG) and
Pull-up/Pull-down structures (PCIOUTLX, PCIOUTHX, PCIOUTLN, PCIOUTHN )
(contact intusoft if you are having trouble with this step)


IBIS Level 3 - Intusoft's Enhanced Subcircuit w/IsSpice3 extensions

Enter the Package parasitic values from the IBIS data sheet into the
elements ROPKG, LOPKG, COPKG, and CCOMP.

Calculate the DRVR resistances. Insert the values into the If-Then-Else
statement, B1, in the DRVR subcircuit. 
Rise Resistor value = 800/(Rise_Ramp_Time)
Fall Resistor value = 800/(Fall_Ramp_Time)
For example, with the Rise Ramp Time = 5.0/1.0 (160 Ohms)
and the Fall Ramp Time = 6.0/1.0 (133.33 Ohms)
the B1 statement in the DRVR subcircuit would be
B1 0 4 I= V(1) > 1.2 ? V(2,4)/160 : V(3,4)/133.33
(This step not required for Input only loads)

Construct SPICE models for the diodes and MOSFETs based on the V-I 
characteristics given.
Diode Clamps (DIODEV, and DIODEG) and
Pull-up/Pull-down structures (PCIOUTLX, PCIOUTHX, PCIOUTLN, PCIOUTHN )
(contact intusoft if you are having trouble with this step)
