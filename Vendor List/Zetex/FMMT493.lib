*ZETEX  FMMT493 Spice model  Last revision 19/10/98
*
*This model was prepared using MicroSim PSpice.
*Spice software which does not support RCO & GAMMA will 
*model the quasi-saturation region incorrectly.  The
*resulting model will return optimistic values for
*forward Vcesat, current gain and Tdon.  
*To improve simulation in a simplified model try 
*increasing RE and decreasing BF and IKF
