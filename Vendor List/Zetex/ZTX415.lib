*ZETEX  ZTX415 Spice model   Last Revision 29/7/99
*
*The model below simulates the normal transistor operation.  If you 
*wish to simulate the transistor in avalanche a simple model can be 
*constructed using a switch in series with a resistor, a voltage source 
*and an inductor.  For initial simulation with Vcc of 240V and minimum 
*lead length try 2ohm, 40V and 4nH.  The avalanche performance is 
*highly dependent on the external circuit components and 
*interconnections which must be modelled with stray inductance and 
*resistive losses.
*
*This model was prepared using MicroSim PSpice.
*Spice software which does not support RCO & GAMMA will 
*model the quasi-saturation region incorrectly.  The
*resulting model will return optimistic values for
*forward Vcesat, current gain and Tdon.  
*To improve simulation in a simplified model try 
*increasing RE and decreasing BF and IKF
