*ZETEX  FMMT593 Spice Model   Last revision 22/7/99
*
*   This model was prepared using MicroSim PSpice.
*   Spice software which does not support RCO & GAMMA will 
*   model the quasi-saturation region incorrectly.  The
*   resulting model will return optimistic values for
*   forward Vcesat, current gain and Tdon.  
*   To improve simulation in a simplified model try 
*   increasing RE and decreasing BF and IKF
