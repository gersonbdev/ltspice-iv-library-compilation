* The parameters in this model library were derived from:
*
*   The TTL Data Book, Texas Instruments, 1985, vol. 2
*   ALS/AS Logic Data Book, Texas Instruments, 1986
*     
*   High-speed CMOS Logic Data Book, Texas Instruments, 1988
*     
*   F Logic Data Book, Texas Instruments, 1987
*
*   FAST Data Book, Fairchild, 1982
*
*   PHILIPS Data Book, 1990
*
*   Philips ECL Databook June 1990
*
*   Programmable Logic Devices Databook and Design Guide,
*   1989 Edition, National Semiconductor
*
*   and other sources noted with the device models.
*
* Each device is modeled by a subcircuit.  The subcircuit name is the
* part name.  The interface pins of the subcircuit have the same name 
* as the pin labels in the data book.  The general order is inputs
* followed by outputs, but on the more complex devices you will have
* to look at the subcircuit definition. The word "BAR" is appended to 
* inverted inputs or outputs.
*
* The timing charactistics from the data book are included in the models, 
* with all data sheet effects modeled, unless noted in the comments in the
* header of the model.
*
* If a device contains multiple, independent, identical functions, only 
* one is contained in the subcircuit. (e.g. the 7400 contains four two-
* input NAND gates, but there is only one in the 7400 subckt.)
